I'm an **economist** developing a career in **Data Science**.
I hold a **Bachelors' degree in Business Economics** from **Universidad Torcuato Di Tella** and 
a **Master's Degree in Business Analytics** from the same institution. 

I've developed my professional trajectory in the technology sector.
I'm currently part of the **Applied Machine Learning Team** at **[MercadoLibre](https://investor.mercadolibre.com/investor-relations)**, 
where I work building **machine learning models** to address **challenging problems** 
across the company's business units. Previously, I've worked at **[Despegar.com](https://investor.despegar.com/home/default.aspx)** and Google. 


I aim to become an **expert** in the application of state of the art **Data Science techniques** 
to bring **solutions** to different **business problems** in different industries.
